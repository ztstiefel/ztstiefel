## Bio

With nearly a decade of experience as a choir director in Title I public schools, I excel in managing and leading diverse individuals towards shared goals. In addition to my extensive knowledge of music theory and vocal techniques, I have branched out from the typical teacher path by learning technical skills in Python,  SQL, and R with experience in data visualization and analytics. I use these skills daily to inform my decisions when addressing student performance, program finances, and inventory. My ability to streamline the management of a choir program of nearly 400 students has created ease of communication and access to information amongst colleagues and parents, leaving time and energy to be reallocated to the needs of a post-Covid student body. My unique skill set enables me to make a significant impact on my students and the broader community.

In my spare time, I am a part-time camera operator and media coordinator for the CFISD Berry Center, with duties ranging from sports events to dances to graduation ceremonies.
